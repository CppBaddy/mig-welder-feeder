# mig-welder-feeder
MIG welder wire feeder using step motor. Provides precision control of speed. In-place replacement for PWM controlled DC motor.
Also added 2-1 mode to help weld thin sheet metal (autobody work). Two seconds welding then one second wire retrive. Then two seconds welding and so on.
